SOMNOS is a register based assembly processor.
The registers are numbered 0-31.

My goals are to have a processor capable of efficient
multithreading and scheduling

Instructions:
LI - Load Immediate
ex:
	LI 2 35

Loads the number 35 into register 2

MOV - Move
ex:
	MOV 6 17

Copies the value in register 6 to register 17

ADD - Add (duh)
ex:
	ADD 3 4 8

Adds the values in registers 3 and 4 and stores
the result in register 8

SUB - Subtract
ex:
	SUB 2 4 3

Subtracts the value in register 2 from the value
in register 4 and stores the result in register 3

MUL - Multiply
ex:
	MUL 1 2 3

Multiplies the values in registers 1 and 2 and
stores the result in register 3

DIV - Divide
ex:
	DIV 3 8 4

Divides the value in register 3 by the value in
register 8 and stores the result in register 4
