Short Term Goal: Support for strings in the 'assembly' code

Goal: To build a virtual computer from a very low level base (assembly at first, maybe simulating some sort of logic circuitry later?) and build up to multithreading, some sort of console, programs, a filesystem, and more!

To Run:
build the program with make, cd into the bin directory, and run it. You have to run it from bin so the program can find the assembly files
